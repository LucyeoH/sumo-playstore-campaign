# Frequently Asked Questions

<div class="content-box faq" markdown="1">

### What is this campaign?

We are testing a new tool to allow contributors to respond to Firefox Playstore reviews at scale in their language.

### When is the campaign?

The campaign runs from the 2nd to 9th of June. 

### Can I run an event outside the campaign dates?

Yes you can! However we encourage you to have your event in the campaign dates so you can coordinate with your fellow Mozillians.

### How can I participate?

You can either <a href="{{ '/host/' | prepend: site.baseurl }}">host</a> an event or <a href="{{ '/participate/' | prepend: site.baseurl }}">participate</a> in an event organized in your region.

### How does the tool work? Will my responses actually show up on the Google Play Store? 

Using this tool, once your response is reviewed it will show up on the Google Play Store <a href="https://discourse-paas-production-content.s3.amazonaws.com/optimized/3X/1/7/17d7f260c47e31ab41af864a9b118440dcfaa20a_1_690x230.png"> like this</a>, and the person who wrote the review will be notified.
